issues dev
- when release a new image(rollout)- deployment with same process broke replica,. will try new approach

best approach i think is isolation
- project_infra
- dev deployment
- staging deployment

- seperate dev/infra   and dev deployment - fine in 1 round
- error once deploy changes in app- - wip
